## Tips for Better Results

1. **Be Specific**: Instead of "search something", try "search for React performance optimization techniques"

2. **Use Keywords**: Include relevant keywords like "tutorial", "documentation", "examples", "best practices"

3. **Context Matters**: Provide context for better results - "search for beginner-friendly Python tutorials"

4. **Try Different Phrasings**: If one query doesn't work well, rephrase it

## Testing Your Setup

Try these simple queries to test if your MCP integration is working:

1. **Basic Search**: `search for hello world examples`
2. **Tech Query**: `find JavaScript tutorials`
3. **Documentation**: `search for API documentation`
4. **General**: `what is cloud computing?`

## Troubleshooting

If you're not getting responses:

1. **Check Server Status**: Go to "MCP Servers" tab and ensure servers are "connected"
2. **Verify Tools**: Make sure your servers have available tools
3. **Check Console**: Open browser dev tools to check for errors
4. **Reconnect**: Try disconnecting and reconnecting your MCP servers

## Advanced Usage

For more complex queries, you can:

1. **Chain Queries**: Ask follow-up questions based on previous responses
2. **Be Specific**: Request specific formats like "give me code examples"
3. **Ask for Comparisons**: "compare X vs Y"
4. **Request Explanations**: "explain how X works"

Remember: The quality of responses depends on your connected MCP servers and their available tools!
